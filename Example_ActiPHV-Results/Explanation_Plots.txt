In this directory you find the ActiPHV results for the 
example image sequence and tracking data.

The plots show the following:
PhaseIdentification.pdf: 
	Kalman-filtered signal with cuts that separate different
	phases.

PhaseIdentification2.pdf:
	Same as PhaseIdentification.pdf without IDs

PhaseIdentification_rawSignal.pdf:
	Identified phases on unfiltered signal.

PhaseIdentification_gaussFilteredSignal.pdf:
	This plot shows the gauss-filtered signal used 
	for maxima detection.
		yellow line: Kalman-filtered signal
		blue line: gauss-filtered signal
		red vertical lines: phase cuts
